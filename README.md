The "Final_Website_Traffic_ForeCasting" script presents a comprehensive approach to forecasting website traffic through a combination of traditional time series analysis and modern machine learning techniques. Key aspects include:
Data Preparation: The code effectively preprocesses raw data by converting date formats, cleaning numeric columns, and addressing outliers, ensuring the dataset is suitable for analysis.

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization techniques are employed to understand data distributions, detect outliers, and assess stationarity. Functions for generating ACF and PACF plots further aid in understanding the time series characteristics.

> Modeling Approaches: The script implements both SARIMA for time series forecasting and machine learning algorithms (XGBoost and Random Forest) for predicting website traffic. Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as AIC, BIC, and RMSE, allowing for the selection of the best-performing models.

> Future Predictions: The models are utilized to generate predictions for future traffic, filling missing values with random samples from existing data, and the results are visualized for comparison against actual values.

> Robustness: The integration of statistical methods and machine learning creates a robust framework for forecasting, enabling better understanding and planning for website traffic.

> Overall, the script is a valuable resource for practitioners looking to analyze and predict website traffic, combining statistical rigor with machine learning innovations. Potential improvements include enhanced documentation, modularization, and the exploration of more complex models for further accuracy.
